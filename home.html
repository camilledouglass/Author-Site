		<h2 id='conjuring'>CONJURING MISERY</h2>
		<p>We took mules. Animals didn’t always know how to react to my sister and me. One time I’d been thrown off a mountain by a mule that had been previously owned by miners, and had literally had dynamite set off in her general vicinity on a regular basis. Another time a barely broken stallion with a reputation of being a demon, displayed impeccable manners. He probably recognized the familial connection. I should have bought that damn horse.</p>

		<p>We had some luck though, these mules were a little antsy, but I didn’t think I’d be rolling down the rocky, cacti infested hillside that we were currently on, just out of Misery. Turning in my saddle I checked on Snake. “How’s your ass?”</p>

		<p>She didn’t smile but I saw the telltale twitch at the corner of her mouth. “I have a great ass. How about yours?”</p>
